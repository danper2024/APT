I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Washington Bothell. I completed my doctoral studies from the University of Washington, advised by Dr. Jaime Snyder.  I have a masters in Human-Centered Design and Engineering. I worked in the technology industry as a program manager, product planner, and accessibility strategist.

My Skillset
======
 I am passionate about inclusive, human-computer interaction (HCI). I lead research and interaction design initiatives for designing intuitive and innovative technology products that fit into our lives. I use participatory design and research methods.  For my doctoral research, I conducted grounded design research to envision communication and affective computing that accounts for the social, emotional, and sensory experiences of autistic adults.

My Goals
======
I am excited to bring my inclusive lens to human-computer interaction and software engineering pedagogy. Through scholarship and collaborations, I aim to work with diverse, creative teams dedicated to developing knowledge, education, and technology for social good.
